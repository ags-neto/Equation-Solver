Side notes:

1. This project makes the less use possible of the command window,
the purpose would be to create a .exe with a proper GUI, but we soon 
realized that was too complicated, so this is the closest we could do.
for now...

2. We made this project in English so that we could upload it to github.

3. Making use of the dialog boxes it became very hard to check for invalid
inputs, making use of button options however, overcomes this problem.
